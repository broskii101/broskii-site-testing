          question: "Do I need skiing experience to come along?",
          answer: " Not at all. Broskii trips are beginner-friendly, and we have first-timers on nearly every trip. We’ll guide you through everything — from hiring equipment to booking lessons — so you feel confident and comfortable on the slopes."
        },
        {
          question: "Do I need to come with a group, or can I come alone?",
          answer: "You’re welcome either way. Some brothers come with friends, others join solo — and everyone settles in quickly. Rooms are shared (2 single beds), but if you'd prefer your own space, single occupancy is available for an extra cost."
        },
        {
          question: "I'm not a Muslim, can I still join the trip?",
          answer: "Absolutely, Our trips are open to everyone who's comfortable with a respectful, Muslim-friendly environment. This means things like no alcohol, Halal food, and shared accommodation that aligns with Islamic etiquette. We’ll never say no to a Broskii with a good heart regardless of background"
        },
       {
  question: "What are the available payment options?",
  answer: `We offer two options:
• Bank transfer — no fees, and our preferred method.
• Debit or credit card — available via the booking page, with a 2% processing fee (charged by the payment provider, not Broskii).

You're free to choose whichever works best for you.`

        {
          question: "Is there an option to pay in instalments?",

          question: "Do I need to bring my own ski/snowboard clothing or equipment?",
          answer: `Yes — you’ll need to bring your own ski clothing: jacket, pants, thermals, gloves, goggles, and ski socks.
You don’t need to bring your own skis/snowboard, boots, or helmet — you can rent them through us on the booking form for an additional cost. If you don’t pre-book, rental gear is also available from shops near the hotel.
Note: A full PDF info pack with gear, lessons, flights, and more will be sent once your booking is confirmed..`
        },
        {
          question: "Are ski or snowboard lessons available?",
          answer: "Yes. We offer optional group or private lessons with certified instructors for both skiing and snowboarding. Highly recommended for first-timers. These are not included in the base price and will be quoted separately."
        },
        {
          question: "How many lessons will I need, and what do they cost?",
          answer: `That depends on your experience, how many lessons you want, and whether you go for group or private sessions. As a rough guide:
• Group lessons (2.5 hours): around £40
• Private 1-on-1 lesson (2 hours): around £110

Group lessons are a lot more cost-effective and a great vibe if you're learning with others. Exact prices and options will be in the PDF pack after booking. You can pre-book through us ( or book directly with ski schools at the resort.`
        },
        {
          question: "What's the cost of ski or snowboard hire for the week?",
          answer: `Ski or snowboard hire is typically around £70-£90 for the week, and that includes Skis/Snowboard, boots and a helmet. There are different packages depending on your experience — you can upgrade to higher-performance gear if you like. If you bring your own boots or helmet, it'll be slightly cheaper. Full options and pricing will be included in the PDF info pack once you've booked, so you can choose what suits you best.`
        },
        {
          question: "I'm new to skiing — how many lessons would you recommend?",
          answer: `If it's your first time on the slopes, we'd recommend at least 3–5 group lessons over the first few days. This gives you a solid foundation, helps you build confidence, and makes sure you're staying safe while having fun. Most beginners start with 2.5 hour daily group lessons, which strike a good balance between learning and having time to practice on your own. You can always add more if you feel you need it — or even book a private session later in the week to fine-tune your skills.`
        },
        {
          question: "Who will be in the group lessons? Will I be learning with other brothers on the trip?",
          answer: `Where possible, we'll group you with other brothers from the trip who are at a similar level — especially if you're all beginners. It makes the experience more fun, supportive, and a lot more relaxed. That said, group lessons are run by the resort's ski schools, so sometimes you may be placed with other learners outside our group — but we'll always do our best to coordinate and keep you with familiar faces wherever we can.`
        },
        {
          question: "What experience level is required?",
          answer: "All levels are welcome — from complete beginners to seasoned skiers and snowboarders."

          question: "Can I bring my own skis or snowboard gear?",
          answer: "Yes — you're welcome to bring your own gear. Just let us know on the booking form so we can make the necessary arrangements. Please note that airlines may apply additional charges for transporting ski/snowboard equipment, which would be your responsibility."
        },
        {
          question: "What if I don't want to ski every day?",
          answer: "That's totally fine — it's your trip! Some brothers take rest days to relax, explore the area, or unwind in the spa. You're free to do what works best for you."

        },
        {
          question: "Are meals included in the package?",
          answer: `Meals are not included. We usually stay in self-catering apartments, and brothers often bring frozen halal meat from the UK (in cool bags), then shop locally for groceries to cook together. This keeps costs low, and the grocery/meat cost is split between the apartment group.

Once your booking is confirmed, you'll be added to the Broskii Trip WhatsApp group — and then to your apartment sub-group to discuss food plans.

If you prefer to eat out, there are plenty of local restaurants nearby.`

We also recommend reviewing any travel updates or entry requirements closer to the time of travel."

If you're not coming via London, that's totally fine — we'll support you in finding a good flight plan and make sure you can meet with the group when you arrive.

        },
        {
          question: "Can I bring a carry-on only?",
          answer: "It’s possible, but we strongly recommend checking in a suitcase due to bulky winter gear. Most airlines include a 23kg checked bag — full details will be in the info pack once booking is confirmed."

        },
        {
          question: "How much spending money should I bring?",
          answer: "It depends on your meal choices and extras, but most brothers bring around £150–£300 for groceries, meals out, and personal expenses. If you're renting ski gear or taking lessons, factor that in too."
